# ppx_log_calls #

ppx_log_calls is a tool that helps OCaml developers debugging their
programs. It is a ppx deriver that adds logging to any function whose
definition is annotated by a `%log` extension point.
Any call to a function with such an annotation is logged at execution time,
including any parameter value for which an explicit type anotation is given.

Check out [ppx_minidebug](https://github.com/lukstafi/ppx_minidebug/tree/main)
for a potentially more mature project offering similar functionality.

## Example ##

```
let%log f ?(x : int option) (y : bool) z = ignore (x, y, z)

let () = f true "z"
```

The program above leads to the following console output:
```
f ?x:None true _
```

Note that the value `"z"` is not printed since no explicit type is given for the parameter `z`.

## Usage ##

When using dune it suffices to add the following stanzas to your project's `dune` file:
```
(preprocess (pps ppx_deriving.show ppx_log_calls))
(libraries ppx_log_calls.runtime)
 ```

Then simply add a `%log` annotation to any `let`-binding for the defined
function(s) to be logged. In order for the supplied arguments to be displayed
as well an explicit type annotation have to be supplied as well as a
pretty-printing function for that type.

If you write for example :
```
let%log f (x : mytype) = ignore x
```
Then there should be a pretty-printing function with the name `pp_mytype` in
scope. If the type name is `t` then the pretty-printer is simply called `pp`.

Note that this naming scheme is compatible with the naming of pretty-printing
functions generated by [ppx_deriving.show](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ppx_deriving/).

Look at `test/basic.ml` for a simple example. It can be executed by running `dune test -f`.
